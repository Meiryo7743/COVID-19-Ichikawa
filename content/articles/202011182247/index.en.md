This site uses some tools to keep information of COVID-19 in Ichikawa up-to-date. However, I noticed that they were not able to fetch the data because of a bug. So **I decided to stop updating this site until the bug is fixed.**

You can get the latest COVID-19 information on the city official website, but it may be difficult to make out without a translator. Here are the links:

- [Patients with symptoms](https://www.city.ichikawa.lg.jp/pub01/hasseijokyo.html#m04)
- [Patients without symptoms](https://www.city.ichikawa.lg.jp/pub01/hasseijokyo.html#m05)

I apologize for the inconvenience. Thank you for your understanding.
