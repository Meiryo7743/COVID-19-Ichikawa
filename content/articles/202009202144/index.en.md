title: "Kounodai Elementary School Will Be Temporarily Closed"
---

According to the announcement by Ichikawa City, the 49th asymptomatic case is a student at Kounodai Elementary School. In addition, it was also made public that another student has been infected. Please note that **Kounodai Elementary School will be temporarily closed from September 23 to October 2** for cleaning up and so on.

As a side note, [the original press](https://www.city.ichikawa.lg.jp/pub01/hasseijokyo.html) is below:

> 無症状病原体保有者の市内在住者 49 例目は国府台小学校の児童です。20 日（日）にも同校児童 1 名が新型コロナウイルスのＰＣＲ検査で陽性と判明しています。
>
> 複数世帯から同時期に陽性者が判明し、業者による消毒や濃厚接触者の確認等を行うため、23 日（水）より 25 日（金）まで当該校を全校臨時休業といたします。

In Kashiwa City, there is a school which has been closed temporarily due to a outbreak of COVID-19 infection. I hope Kohnodai Elementary School does not have to go through this kind of situation ...

Unfortunately, the possibility of COVID-19 infection can not be always zero even if you take any measures or prepare for. However, it is important for us to prevent the disease. Washing your hands and gargling, drinking water frequently, etc. may be obvious, but we should be more aware of this.

I partly fixed this article owing to extent the school temporary closure period by a week.

Based on information released by the city, the results of PCR test for the people concerned were all negative.

> なお、国府台小学校で児童・担任教諭等関係者に対して行った市によるＰＣＲ検査については全員陰性でした。
