title: "The Site Has Been Renewed!"
---

Thank you for visiting this website.

Today I had renewed this site. Some contents have been changed due to this. [For more details, please refer to the following](#changes).

I felt that previous template is too hard to maintain. So I decided to create original design by using Hugo. The new design is lighter and comfortable.

The source code is available on GitHub. There is still a lot of work, updating the data, improve the translations, and so on ... If you are interested in, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Meiryo7743/covid-19-ichikawa/).
