title: "The Website Will Be Closed"
---

Hello, I am Meiryo7743, the site owner of this website.

I'm afraid that the website is going to be closed on January 31st, 2021 (JST). I would like to express my gratitude to those who have used the website although it is less than a year when this site was published.

Please refer to the following for more information. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me on [the contact form](https://forms.gle/A1a849XahuB9w7CH6)

## The final day

- January 31st, 2021 (JST)

## Reasons

- I'm too busy to update and maintain the website.
- Ichikawa City and news media actively spread information about COVID-19 and its related on their own website or SNS etc. I feel that this website is no longer needed.
- According to Google Analytics, the number of accesses to the website is low. It means there is no demand for this site.

## What to do after the end

### Website

All of the contents on the website will be unavailable after the service is terminated.

If you would like to continue to get the latest information on COVID-19, please visit [Ichikawa City official website](https://www.city.ichikawa.lg.jp/catpage/kurashi-shingatacorona.html), [Chiba Prefecture official website](https://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/cate/kfk/kenkou-iryou/kenkouzukuri/kansenshou/coronavirus.html), and so on, instead. For your information, "Changes in the Rates of Toei Subway Passengers" is available on [Tokyo Metropolitan Government COVID-19 Information Website](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en/).

### Contact form

[The contact form](https://forms.gle/A1a849XahuB9w7CH6) will be accepted until March 31st, 2021 (JST), but I plan to keep on replying unanswered inquiries from the following month onward.

### Source Code

You can get the source code of this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/Meiryo7743/covid-19-ichikawa) even after the service is closed. However, I am going to stop both maintenance the repository and accepting issues and pull requests.
