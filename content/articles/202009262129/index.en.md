title: "Closure Period of Kounodai Elementary School Was Extended; and Daiichi Junior High School Will Be Closed for a Grade"
---

Today, Ichikawa City made public that [students at Kounodai Elementary School got infected, and a student at Daiichi Junior High School also did](https://www.city.ichikawa.lg.jp/pub01/hasseijokyo.html). As a result, **Kounodai Elementary School is extending its temporary closing time by a week and will be closed until Friday, October 2**. **Daiichi Junior High School will close the grades with infected students until the end of this month, Wednesday, September 30**. The city also announced that PCR testing is going to be carried out on the students at these schools.

The original text is as follows:

> なお、感染者の市内在住者 343 例目、344 例目は国府台小学校の児童、無症状病原体保有者の市内在住者 55 例目は第一中学校の生徒です。
>
> 国府台小学校については、9 月 23 日(水)から 25 日(金)までの全校臨時休を 10 月 2 日(金)まで延長、第一中学校については、9 月 28 日(月)から 30 日(水)まで当該学年の学年閉鎖とし、関係者に対し、市による PCR 検査を実施してまいります。

This time, since these schools are located in close to each other by accident, some may wonder that the two have something to do with the outbreaks. According to the information released by the City and Chiba Prefecture, however, **the route of the infection is presumed to be from their each families, which means that the two cases are completely different**.

I sometimes posts an article like this in case of telling more information which cannot describe in the graphs, tables, or charts. You are able to access such articles from [“News” section in the page of “Updates on COVID-19 in Ichikawa”](https://stopcovid19-ichikawa.netlify.app/en/#updates-on-covid-19-in-ichikawa), and I hope you would pay attention to them as well.
