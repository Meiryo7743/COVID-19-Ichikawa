On December 4, 2020, Chiba Prefecture withdrew the announcement of the 615th case of coronavirus patients with symptoms in Ichikawa City (the 5836th in Chiba Prefecture).

Because of that, **Ichikawa City gave again each of them a number after the 616th case**. For instance, the 616th case is now listed as 615th. This was probably done to keep data integrity.

[The original press](https://www.city.ichikawa.lg.jp/pub01/hasseijokyo.html) as follows:

> なお、市内 615 例目（県内 5836 例目）の感染者について、県から取り下げの発表がありました。このため、615 例目以降の番号を繰り上げて表記しています。

For the above reason, **the contents on this website have made the same correction**.
